Low-Latency Connection / client and server (http://llcon.sourceforge.net)


INTRODUCTION:
The llcon software enables musicians to play together over the internet. The
way it works is that there must be one server which collects the audio data
from each client, mixes all together and sends the mix back to each client.
The minimum internet connection speed at each client must be 256 kbps upstream
and 1 Mbit downstream. The server software must be located at a server with a
very fast internet connection (at least 1 Mbps for up- and downstream) and a
very low ping time. To get satisfactory results, the ping time from the client
computer to the server should not exceed 30 ms average and the network jitter
should be as low as 2-5 ms (To get a low ping time on DSL connections, an
extra option "DSL fast path" should be enabled by your internet provider).

The llcon software package includes both, the server and the client
functionality which can be selected by using command line arguments.

For starting server type ./llcon -s

For test purpose it is possible to run server and client on the same computer. For
this setup first start the server and then the client. Type in 127.0.0.1 for the
IP address in the client software.
